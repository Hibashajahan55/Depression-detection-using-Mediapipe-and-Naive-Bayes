# DEPRESSION DETECTION USING MEDIAPIPE AND NAIVE BAYES
This project aims to detect signs of depression through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It combines sentiment analysis of textual responses to the PHQ-9 questionnaire with facial recognition technology using MediaPipe to provide a comprehensive assessment of an individual's mental health.

# OVERVIEW
The model evaluates textual data from users based on their responses to the PHQ-9 questionnaire, which is a widely recognized tool for screening depression. Sentiment analysis is performed using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Additionally, facial recognition techniques from MediaPipe are employed to analyze facial features and detect potential indicators of depression.

# FEATURES
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Intuitive design for easy interaction.
* Textual Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes Naive Bayes for evaluating responses to the PHQ-9 questionnaire.
* Facial Recognition: Uses MediaPipe to analyze facial expressions and features.
* Combined Assessment: Integrates both textual and facial data for a comprehensive depression detection model.

# CONCLUSION


The Depression Detection project effectively combines sentiment analysis and facial recognition to assess signs of depression. By utilizing the PHQ-9 questionnaire alongside Naive Bayes for textual evaluation and MediaPipe for facial analysis, the model provides a comprehensive tool for understanding mental health.

This initiative not only raises awareness about depression but also serves as a resource for individuals seeking insights into their mental well-being. Future enhancements could involve expanding the dataset, refining the algorithms, and improving the user interface for a more seamless experience.

As mental health awareness continues to grow, this project contributes valuable insights and tools to support individuals in their mental health journeys. We encourage further exploration and development in this vital area.
